# Aprenda Portugues

## An easy to use app for practicing Portuguese using spaced repetition method

### Introduction

You are not alone if you studied Spanish in for many years in high school and
all you remember now is Hola. You might even have studied a lot at the time and
aced all your exams. How did that happen? Where did all the knowledge go?

That's because stuffing your brain with a large amount of information at once is
not an effective way for long-term knowledge retention. Yet, we all do it when
we need to study.

Aprenda Portugues is an application designed after the flashcards method of
studying. Except, we do the sorting for you so you can focus on learning.

### Spaced Repetition

If you want to retain what you learn in your long-term memory, you need to
refresh your knowledge every so often.

"[Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is a
learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between
subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the
psychological spacing effect."
